# inews-proxy
This is my first upload to github - this project actually is clone copy of an working process, that will be updated from time to time to github.

The general concept of inews proxy project - is to simplify comlpex and hard avid inews wsapi (SOAP based API protocol) to simple gateway that will provide to the clients parsed, JSON-formatted lineups information.
