# inews-proxy
This is my firs upload to github - this project actually is clone copy of an working process' that will be updated from time to time.

The general idea of inews proxy - is to simplify comlpex and hard avid inews wsapi (SOAP based API protocol) to simple gateway that will provide to users parsed, JSON-formatted lineups information.
